Revolution OS Reflections 

1.	What was the point made by Bill Gates in his open Letter to Hobbyists? (7:22 – 9:08)

The point made by Bill Gates in his open Letter to Hobbyists was for the relatively new concept of proprietary. 
The concept of proprietary was the practice of computer users had been to freely pass around software with very 
little thought of ownership. The people who develop the software is stolen and shared to others. In the letter 
bill Gates states “hardware must be paid for but software is something to share”. The hard work that programmers 
that invented the software and don’t get paid for it is something that Bill Gates question. 


2.	What did Richard Stallman describe as an ethical dilemma? (9:23- 11:00)

Richard Stallman describes the whole idea of commercial software as an ethical dilemma. Richard could not get the 
company that owned on the code to let him fix it even thought it would benefit the company in the end. The developers 
of the systems don’t share with other people. They tried to control the users, and to get the system they user would have 
to sign a contract that the user is unable to share it with anyone else from the outside world.  Richard said that when signing 
that contract, you are turning into a bad person.  



3.	What are the freedoms that enable people to form a community? (15: 06 – 15:13)
The freedoms that enable people to form a community was the freedom to make changes if the individual wants to, hire someone else 
to make changes for you, to make copies and share with others, making improvements and publish them for free software.
