I found very difficult to use Atom compared with GitHub. 
In my opinion there is more work to be done with atom. 
Maybe its because I am not very familiar how to use it. 
I do appereciate on the side tab there is an area where you can see your unstaged changes 
and staged changes also committing the change is there as well. The command-based method 
used in labs 1 and 2 are a bit different in GitHub first you would need to clone the files 
from GitHub then once you added other files then you used the command "git add *". 
After that you would do "git status" to see where the files are located. Then, do git commit -m "..." <- inside 
the " " you would put a comment of what changes you have made. Finally GitHub would ask you the username and password
of your GitHub and then you can push your changes and refresh the page in the browers to see the updated files uploaded.

In atom I don't see the changes made when committing the assignment. the commands are almost the same but it is displayed for you.
It seems to be a lot quicker. But I would prefer to use GitHub because its easier.
